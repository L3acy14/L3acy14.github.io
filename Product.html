                        <h9>
                            This is my favorite toner ever. I find that it pulls the dirtiest and gross 
                            makeup remnants off of my face. On top of that, this product is anti-aging, 
                            evens skin tone, and has exfoliating properties. This is always a saving grace 
                            during breakouts, so if you have once prone skin I highly recommend you give 
                            this product a try.

                        <h9>
                            My favorite shampoo without fail. I don’t know what it is about this dry shampoo, 
                            but whatever the formula is fantastic. The smallest amount touches up my hair 
                            effortlessly. Pro tip - if you know your hair will be dirty the next day, put some 
                            dry shampoo in it and don’t rub it in. Just sleep and when you wake up your hair 
                            will have absorbed a ton of the dry shampoo and then you can just rub the rest away. 
                            Does the trick every time. Get yours <a class="nav-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071YTZ539/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=jillci-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B071YTZ539&linkId=15963030adef74aa081d8a5b68a5013d">here!</a>

                        <h9>
                            Holy glow, I love this palette! It comes with six different highlight shades so there 
                            is something in there for every skin tone and every makeup look. My personal favorite 
                            in the palette is a stunner and, trust me, it lives up to its name. Even in low light, 
                            my highlight stands out. I’ll be so sad when I hit pan on that one! Get yours <a class="nav-link" href="https://www.ulta.com/tarteist-pro-glow-highlight-contour-palette?productId=xlsImpprod15031181">here!</a>

                                            For sure my go-to favorite lipstick. This formula is silky smooth and 
                                            dries almost totally matte without drying out my lips. I have naturally 
                                            very dry lips, so that is huge for me. It’s long wearing and this color, 
                                            in particular, is the perfect everyday color for me.

                                                        me it’s that I love brushing my hair. I do it first thing when I wake up and probably 
                                                        three more times at a minimum for the rest of the day. And my wet brush has changed 
                                                        the game. It’s super gentle on wet hair and helps to stop breakage. Plus it pulls 
                                                        through tangles without damaging your hair or hurting. You have got to try this asap!

<!-- NECESSARY <script> LINKS. The three <script> links below add jQuery, popper.js, and Bootstrap 4 JavaScript. These are libraries of scripts that are necessary to make Bootstrap's interactive and animated components work (e.g., dropdown menus, buttons, alerts, carousels, collapsing navbars and content areas, modals, popups, tooltips, etc). These three <script> links MUST appear in THIS ORDER; this is because both popper.js and the Bootstrap scripts rely on jQuery to work, so jQuery must load into your page first. We add these links at the bottom of the <body> element instead of in the <head> element so the scripts won't be loaded into your site until they're needed, which helps with your site's speed and functionality. -->
